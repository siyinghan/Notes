- What makes you unique? (What skills and talents set you apart?)
- What have you accomplished thus for? (think about your accomplishments, particularly those enjoyable accomplishments you brainstormed earlier)
- What qualities make you truly distinctive? (think about what qualities make you distictive)
- What characteristics describe you?
- What problems have you solved? (what projects you've worked on that you enjoyed, how can these experiences benefit the organization you're interested in?)



For each previous job held, how did you contribute to the success of the organization? Use specific numbers or percentages.



For each previous job held, how did you measure your success? What was your favorite project? Why?



Who were the people you worked best with? What traits of their resonated with you?
