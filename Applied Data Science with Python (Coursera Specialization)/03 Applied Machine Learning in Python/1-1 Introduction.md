# 1-1 Introduction

Hi, and welcome to the applied machine learning component of the University of Michigan's online course in Applied Data Science. My name is Kevin Collins-Thompson and I'm an Associate Professor of Information and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I'll be your instructor for this part of the course. I have about 20 years of research and development experience in applying machine learning to a wide variety of problems in both academia and industry, everything from language tutoring software to commercial search engines. This is an incredibly exciting time to be involved in machine learning, and I hope this part of the course inspires you to look more deeply into this fascinating world. This week, you'll learn what machine learning is and why it's important to data science, how machine learning is applied to key problems in our information economy, and how to set up your first machine learning application in Python.

So what defines the field of **machine learning**?

In a lot of cases when a computing problem needs to be solved, for example, storing and retrieving data from a database, the way we often address it is to write a program that manually specifies a series of programming steps that need to be run to solve that particular problem. This works great for the vast number of computer science problems that are out there. However, not all problems lend themselves to being solved effectively by writing a handcrafted program or set of rules. For example, how would you write down a set of rules in a programming language for accurately converting human speech to text?
