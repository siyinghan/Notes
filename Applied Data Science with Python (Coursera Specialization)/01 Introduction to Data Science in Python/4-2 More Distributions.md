# 4-2 More Distributions

Many of the distributions you use in data science are not discrete binomial, and instead are continues where the value of the given observation isn't a category like heads or tails, but can be represented by a real number. It's common to then graph these distributions when talking about them, where the **x axis is the value of the observation** and the **y axis represents the probability** that a given observation will occur.
