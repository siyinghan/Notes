# 1-2 Dates and Times

In Python, you can get the current time since the epoch using the `time` module:
```python
import datetime as dt
import time as tm
```

<br/>

TimeÂ returns the current time in seconds since the `Epoch` (January 1st, 1970):
```python
tm.time()
```
```1576251816.63```

<br/>

You can then create a `timestamp` using the `fromtimestamp` function on the `datetime` object:
```python
dtnow = dt.datetime.fromtimestamp(tm.time())
dtnow
```
```datetime.datetime(2019, 12, 13, 15, 44, 34, 320508)```

<br/>

When we print this value out, we see that the `year`, `month`, `day`, and so forth are also print out. The `datetime` object has handy attributes to get the representative `hour`, `day`, `second`, etc. <br/>
Handy `datetime` attributes:
```python
# get year, month, day, etc.from a datetime
dtnow.year, dtnow.month, dtnow.day, dtnow.hour, dtnow.minute, dtnow.second
```
```(2019, 4, 12, 7, 57, 4)```
