# 3-4 Scales

Now that we've covered many of the mechanics of Pandas, I want to stop and talk for a moment about data types and scales. We've already seen that Pandas supports a number of different computational data types such as strings, integers and floating point numbers. What this doesn't capture is what we call the scale of the data. Let's say that we have a data frame of students and their academic levels such as being in grade 1 or grade 2 and grade 3. There's a difference between a student in grade 1 and a student in grade 2, the same as the difference between a student in grade 8 and a student in grade 9. Well let's think about the final exam scores these students might get on assignments. Is the difference between an A and an A minus the same as the difference between an A minus and a B plus? At the University of Michigan at least, the answer is usually no. We've intuitively seen some different scales, and as we move through data cleaning and statistical analysis and machine learning, it's important to clarify our knowledge and terminology.

As a data scientist there are four scales that it's worth knowing.

* The first is a **ratio scale**. In the ratio scale the measurements units are equally spaced and mathematical operations, such as subtract, division, and multiplication are all valid. Good examples of ratio scale measurements might be the height and weight.
* The next scale is the **interval scale**. In the interval scale the measurement units are equally spaced like the ratio scale. But there's no clear absence of value. That is there isn't a true zero, and so operation such as multiplication and division are not valid. An example of the interval scale might be the temperatures measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Since there's never an absence of temperature and 0 degrees is a meaningful value of temperature. The direction on a campus might be another good example where 0 degrees on the campus doesn't indicate a lack of direction. For most of the work you do at data mining, the differences between the ratio and interval scales might not be clearly apparent or important than the algorithm you're applying. But it's important to have this clear in your mind when you're applying advanced statistical tests.
* The next scale is the **ordinal scale**, and this is also important. In the ordinal scale the order of values is important but the differences between the values are not equally spaced. Here is a grading method that is used in many classes at the University of Michigan as a great example, where letter grades are given with pluses and minuses. But when you compare this to percentage values you see that a letter by itself covers 4% of the available grades and that a letter with a plus or minus is usually just 4% for the available grades. Based on this, it would be odd if there were as many students who received an A plus or A minus as there were who received a straight A. Ordinal data is very common in machine learning and can sometimes be a challenge to work with.
* The last scale I'll mention is the **nominal scale** which is often just called **categorical data**. Here the names of teams in a sport might be good example. There are a limited number of teams but changing their order or playing mathematical function to them is meaningless. Categorical values are very common and we generally refer to categories where there are only two possible values as binary.

So why did I stop talking about Pandas and jump into this discussion of scale. Well, given how important they are in statistics and machine learning, Pandas has a number of interesting functions to deal with converting between measurement scales. Let's start first with nominal data, which in Pandas is called categorical data. Panda is actually has a built in type for categorical data and you could set a column of your data to categorical data by using the `astype` method. As type tries to change the underlying type of your data, in this case to category data. You can further change this to ordinal data by passing in an ordered flags set to true and passing in the categories in an ordered fashion:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(['A+', 'A', 'A-', 'B+', 'B', 'B-', 'C+', 'C', 'C-', 'D+', 'D'],
                  index=['excellent', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'ok', 'ok', 'ok', 'poor', 'poor'])
df.rename(columns={0: 'Grades'}, inplace=True)
df
```
