# 3-4 Heatmaps

**Heatmaps** are a way to visualize three-dimensional data and to take advantage of spatial proximity of those dimensions. Now, I honestly didn't think I would include heatmaps in this course. I've seen enough bad heatmaps to last me a lifetime. The problem is heatmaps are really quite powerful when you have the right data. Weather data is a great example. You have two dimensions, latitude and longitude, and then we can overlay on top of this a third dimension, say, temperature or rainfall amounts and use color to indicate its intensity.

Here's another good example.
