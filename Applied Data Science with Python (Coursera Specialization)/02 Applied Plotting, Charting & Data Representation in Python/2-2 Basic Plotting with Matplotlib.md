# 2-2 Basic Plotting with Matplotlib

With the `Matplotlib` magic having set the back end for us, we're going to start our plotting journey by making a graph using the `plot` function. A plot has **two axes**, an x-axis along the horizon, and a y-axis which runs vertically. First, let's input the pyplot scripting layer as `plt`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

All of the functions which will run against the Pyplot module are part of the **scripting layer** of the architecture. Let's take a look at the plot function by looking at the docstring:

```python
plt.plot?
```
