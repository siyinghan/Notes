Here's an example from my field of study which was published by Harvard and MIT describing the patterns of access of users in the edX massive open online course platform.

If we consider Cairo's third dimension. It would be tough not to say that this is a fairly dense graphic. The main portion of the graphic, a scatterplot, has two axes which are labeled, as do each of the two subplots to the left and the bottom, which are histograms. The axes for the histograms can be a bit confusing as they bleed into the scatterplot axis, but change the unit of measure and the direction of the measurement.

For instance, in the X axis at the top of the scatter plot, percentage of chapters access is being used as the unit of measure and increases as you move towards the right hand side of the figure. You have the same X axis for the histogram to the left of the graph is in thousands of persons and increases as you move to the left side of the figure. There is some red lines overlayed on the graphic. Breaking the scatter plot roughly into quadrants, but with minimal labeling it is a little unclear what the quadrants end up representing.

Regardless of whether this is a good figure or not, it would certainly be considered an example of a dense figure.
