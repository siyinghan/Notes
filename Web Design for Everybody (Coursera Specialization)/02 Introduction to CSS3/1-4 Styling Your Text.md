**Serif fonts** and **sans-serif fonts**

**Serif fonts:** have the kind of the fancy edges along the side that you used when you were learning calligraphy or different things like that.

**San-serif fonts:** very clean, there is no drop downs or anything like that.

If you do decide that you want to have your own font, or some sort of special web-safe custom font, you need to use something special here called a **font-face rule**.

For the **h1**, the block element, the background color covers the whole width of the page.

For **span**, for inline elements, the background color only goes around just the element and the text itself.

In the second rule, I am saying I want you to really spread out far.
