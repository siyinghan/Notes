Hexadecimal is probably the most common way of doing colors when you look at a lot of people's pages.

**RGBA**: alpha transparency

You have a fourth value on the end that says, I want to use this blue color, but I want kind of make it a little bit see through. If I were to actually make it zero, it would be completely see through.

value 1: it would look just like the regular RGB value.

Select `style` part in the left side, modify the right part directly:

If you are on a desktop or laptop computer, take a minute and try to use Inspect Element. You can try it on any page you would like, but I recommend going to one that is basic, or at the very least, clean code. Can you change the background-color of the page? Here is a screenshot of me playing with the code at wikipedia.org.

On both Chrome and Firefox you can get to Inspect Element by right-clicking on the screen. In Firefox you can also select Tools -> Inspect Element from the options at the top of the browser window. In Chrome you can select View-->Developer --> Developer Tools.

I highlighted the body tag and then used the color picker to change the background color to red.

**Chrome**
