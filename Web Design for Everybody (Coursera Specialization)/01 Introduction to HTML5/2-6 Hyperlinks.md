With an absolute reference in the a `href` section, we need to put a fully formed **url**. You need to have the `http` or `https`, the address, and any type of extra document name you want:

For a relative reference, we slightly change what goes in to the href. Instead of linking to some outside or even internal webpage, we're only going to put, in this case, the file name:

With absolute links, you're basically saying, I am not in charge of this page, somebody else is. So if you're linking to somebody else's page, absolutely use the **absolute link** with the full reference in there.

For relative is when you're developing your own side. And it's really helpful to use **relative links** instead of absolute, so that way if you move your page to a different server, or you move it into a different folder, you don't need to rename everything.
