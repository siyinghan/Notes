# 2-4 Writing Objectives

**Objectives** are most commonly used when you're relatively new to the workforce or do not have much experience in the field you're applying for.

### Bad objective statement example

> Seeking a position where I can contribute to company growth through dedication and application of my ten years of experience, knowledge, and skills.

Your resume objective should align your **skills** and **qualifications** with the employer is looking for. It should not be about your goals, it should be about the **target** employer's goals and matching those goals with your expertise.

**An objective that does not match the organization's direction or the interviewer's perception of that direction can eliminate your resume.**

### Writing a winning objective

1. **Align your mind with the right goals.** (align your **skills** and career directions with an employer's goals)

2. **Start with the organization's mission.**

   Example mission:

   > To combine aggressive strategic marketing with quality products and services at competitive prices to provide the best insurance value for customers.

   The statement captures the **mission** of the organization. It contains a number of **keyword** phrases that you can use.

3. **Parse the mission statement's keywords**

   Make a list like this:

   * strategic marketing
   * quality products
   * quality services
   * competitive prices
   * best insurance value
   * consumers

4. **Craft your statement accordingly**

   Example if you're a *accountant*:

   > To contribute to providing the best insurance for consumers by ensuring accurate accounting methods that will minimize expenses.

   Example if you're a *customer service specialist*:

   > To ensure quality services through top notch customer communication to provide the best insurance value.

   Example if you're an *IT person*:

   > To keep technology systems current and operating to afford consistent competitive prices to achieve the best insurance values.
