# 3-5 Electronic, Scannable and Internal Resumes

### Always Practice Good Writing Resume Writing

* **Use keywords from the job description**
* **List key competencies early in the resume**
* **Write strong accomplishment statements**
* **Spell check and proofread carefully**
* **Match the format to your purpose**

### A Plain Text Version Can Be Useful

* **Good for cut-and-paste submission systems**
* **Suitable for pasting into an email**
* **Format is almost universally compatible**

#### To create a plain text file in most word processing programs:

* **Save as regular plain text (.txt)** (use a monospaced font, like ***Courier***, use a regular font style, ***no bold face*** or ***italics***)
* **Maximum line width of 70 characters** (to ensure a consistent layout with any email client)
* **No formatting will be preserved**
* **Do not use special characters or tabs**
* **Do not use work wrap**

#### A resume prepared for optical scanning will:

* **Use a common sans serif font like Arial** (or ***Optima***, in a font size from ***10*** to ***14*** point)
* **Add space between slashes where used** (so that the slash does not touch the letters)
* **Use laser printing on crisp white stock**
* **Use single-spaced, single-sided copy** (avoid two column format, don't use vertical or horizontal lines)
* **Use UPPERCASE for headings** (place ***your name*** at the top of each page on its own line, do not use italics, underlining, graphics, shading, or bold face)

### Internal Resume Can Help Your Career

* **Document skills and progressive growth**
* **Emphasize your measurable successes** (the use of scannable keywords or concise objectives is not so important, the main point is showing ***measurable successes*** that are relevant to your current employer)
*  **Use during annual performance reviews**
  * An excellent time to present an updated resume is when you have your annual performance review. If you've taken the time to provide quantitative proof of a successful year, you're in a much better position to ask for a promotion or a salary increase, or a bonus.
* **Use with accomplishment reports**
  * This practice would be especially effective if you've been following the strategy we talked about in the first course. Namely, submitting monthly accomplishment status reports to your immediate superior.
