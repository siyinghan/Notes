# 2-5 Finding the Right Words

[**Action Verbs to Refer to Skills**](https://github.com/siyinghan/Notes/blob/master/Interviewing%20and%20Resume%20Writing%20in%20English%20(Coursera%20Specialization)/Material/Action%20Verbs%20to%20Refer%20to%20Skills.pdf)

[**Action Verbs to Describe Accomplishments**](https://github.com/siyinghan/Notes/blob/master/Interviewing%20and%20Resume%20Writing%20in%20English%20(Coursera%20Specialization)/Material/Action%20Verbs%20to%20Describe%20Accomplishments.pdf)

<br/>

Let's say you ***managed the marketing department of 100 people that experience growth under your leadership***. How would you best describe this accomplishment in a resume? Compare these two versions:

> **A.** **Responsible** for a large, profitable department at XYZ Industries.

> **B.** **Managed** a **100-person** marketing department for XYZ Industries, which grew company profits **by 50%**.

**Why to pick the second example?**

* The second example starts off with a strong action word, **managed**. The term **responsible for** provides absolutely no information about how involved you were with the task, plus it robs you of any credit you might due. The work **managed** tells the employer that you have **leadership skills**.
* The second example is **specific**. It tells an employer that you didn't just manage a large department, you manage a department of **100 people**. That shows precisely what your circle of accountability was.
* The second example states exactly how **profitable** your department was. It increased profits by **50%**. Profits grow under your **leadership**, and you get **credit** for that. (On the other hand, in the first example, you get no credit for your department's success. The phrasing gives the feeling that the department basically grew by itself.)

<br/>

Consider another example:

> **A.** **Restructured** the **entire** production department, which **boosted** productivity by 50%.

> **B.** **Organized** the production department, which **increased** productivity by 50%.

Neither one of these is bad, but the first one is stronger.

* To **restructure** is to **rethink**, **innovate**, and **conceptualize** a whole new structure, and that goes far beyond simple organizing.
* The first example emphasized a restructuring of the **entire department**. And *productivity* wasn't simply **increased**, it was **boosted**, a much more potent word.

<br/>

The description **action** words you use on a resume should be ***grouped in terms of their relative power***. For example, you were responsible for **managing**, **developing**, and **implementing** a program. Which word do you put first?

* **Developing** shows an employer that you can create ideas independently. That's very powerful.
* **Managing** shows that you can lead others to accomplish goals. Less powerful, but still powerful.
* **Implementing** shows that you can carry out ideas. That's the least powerful of the three.

So on your resume you say you **developed**, **managed**, and **implemented** the program. That's how you use action words to supercharge your resume.

<br/>

### Writing powerful resumes means both:

* **using powerful language** and
* **avoiding weak language**

### A superior skills summary

1. Uses relevant **keywords** (keywords that the employer will most likely be looking for)
2. Appears **above the fold** (at the top or at least in the top one-third of the page, just below your *professional title*)
3. **Entices** the readers (tells the employer that your resume is worth reading)

<br/>

### Example

Here is an example of a summary section from a resume for **a senior marketing professional**.

> Creative and business-savvy marketing and communications professional with 10 years of progressive experience across a broad range of marketing functions and diverse industry segments. Proven ability to combine vision, creativity, and strong business acumen with well-developed project management and leadership qualities to support go-to-market efforts, product launches, and branding-rebranding initiatives, positioning companies and products for success. **Areas of expertise include:**

This summary captures what defines the candidate as a **professional**. It also conveys what he **enjoys** about his work. And it **aligns with the requirements** that an organization looking for a marketing manager would have.

As with accomplishment statements, the summary section **does not use personal pronouns**, **nor does it use finite verbs**.

This particular candidate went one step further with his summary section. He **listed areas of expertise**. Here's what follows his summary section:

Notice the use of **keyword nouns**. **Nouns** are often more important than verbs because they capture the **keywords** entered as search criteria by the hiring manager. Some of the nouns here repeat what's
found in the summary section. The overall effect is to make the candidate sound exactly like the person the employer hopes to find.

<br/>

### To craft a skills summary

1. **Figure out where you're going** (need to be **concise**, must know exactly what **competencies** to highlight)
   * Ask yourself what **skills** you most enjoy using?
   * What **accomplishment** best illustrate your abilities?
   * What areas you are most **passionate** about working in?
2. **Analyze your target industry** (identify where you want to be, highlighting the importance of our research)
   * Asked yourself what **aligns** most closely with the priorities of the hiring organization?
   * What **competencies** matter most in the target position?
   * What you would look for if you were the hiring manage?
3. **Find your fit and condense**
   * Figure our how you **fit** in, or want to fit in, to the target organization.
   * Identify your **key selling points**.
   * Think about the **organizational problems** you're well positioned to solve.
   * Ask yourself where the **intersection** is of what you want and want your target organization needs.
