# 4-4 The Follow-Up Letter

The **follow-up letter** is the letter you write after an interview.

#### Steps in Writing a Follow-Up Letter

* **Make a connection with the prospective employer and grab his or her attention.**
* **Arouse interest in and desire for your capabilities and skills; reemphasize your fit in the organization.** (But you're going to use a subtle strategy.)
* **Move the reader to call you for an interview.**
  * Use the powerful psychological principle of reciprocity.

You should always send the follow-up letter but as you probably guessed, the follow-up letter is more than just a humble expression of you gratitude. It serves a strategic purpose in your job seeking.

#### Why You Write A Follow-Up Letter

* **To remind the employer of why you are a good fit**
* **To mention capabilities you feel need more emphasis**
  * It also gives you an opportunity to mention any capabilities that you might have not stressed enough in the interview. And you could include additional copies of your work or a recent article pertaining to the employer's industry.
* **To gain a strategic edge over the competition**
  * If you're in the running for the position, a follow up letter could give you the competitive edge you need to win. 

 <br/>

Begin the **follow-up letter** by ***thanking the interviewer for his or her time***.

Example: **I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to meet with you today.**

Notice that this opening is right to the point and uses the word **today**. That makes it look like you went home and wrote the follow-up letter immediately after the interview. This **subtly** communicates that you're on the ball and get things done in a timely fashion.

<br/>

Now you have to grab  the employer's attention. You already know that one of the best ways to do this is to **compliment him or his organization**. Another effective method is to mention **any valuable insights you learned as a result of the interview**. This way, you not only show your genuine appreciation for the interview but you also demonstrate to the employer  your listening skills.

Example: **Your knowledge about [a future trend in the industry] provided me with valuable insights into [a related area].**

If you remember the example from the earlier lesson on constructing a cover letter, you'll use a similar strategy here. So as this example shows, revisit your personal connection with an inside agent in the organization whenever that's possible. It makes you already seem part of the organization and it flatters the employer. Mike praised him and you second the compliment.

Example: **As Mike Walker indicated, your insight into trends in the knowledge management field opened my eyes about the importance of enterprise collaboration in the future.**

<br/>

Example: **The acumen I have won managing the enterprise architecture at [XYZ] would contribute to the success of your CTO group. The interview with you confirmed my initial impression that your organization is growing in a direction that parallels my career goals.**

Observe the specific structure you use here.

* The first sentence is a smooth tie in to the opener. You have thanked the hiring manager for his insights. And now you prove you can make those insights or vision for the future come to life by citing your experience and abilities.
* In the last line you indirectly indicate that you're a **perfect fit** for the the organization.

<br/>

Now the hook in your closing paragraph, your **call to action**. In your call to action, you urge the prospective employer to get in touch with you again but you have to give Mr. Smith a reason to call and one of the best ways to do that is to **offer to solve a problem for him**. This is the **try-before-you-buy** strategy, which you're probably familiar with.

Here is an example of how this strategy works. Let's say, during the interview, Mr. Smith mentioned an ***operational problem*** he struggled with. On your way home, you think about an approach tot he problem. However, you aren't going to give the solution away. You're going to get the employer to ask for it. That's the **hook**. Something like this:

Example: **After thinking over the problem you mentioned about the regional warehouse having hugely different code bases requiring torturous rebuilds, I've come up with an approach that could simplify the process. Please call me at 555 555-1111 to discuss it.**

Here you give the employer a real reason to contact you. This is much more powerful than any of the other calls to action we've discussed so far. It's a matter of simple **reciprocity**. You give the employer your idea in the exchange for a competitive edge over other applicants.

<br/>

That's it. You end up the **follow-up letter** with sincerely. Print a copy of it all from the same paper and with the same font you've been using for your resume and cover letters. Sing your name, preferably in blue ink, send it off.

<br/>

#### Master's Secret

* **Always give the employer a reason to call.**
  * Simply asking an employer to call is not enough. By offering something of real value, you make it in his or her best interest to call you.
* **Keep it simple and to the point.**
  * Like the resume and cover letter, the **follow-up letter** should be extremely focused and direct. Keep it down to one page, three paragraphs.
* **Do the unexpected.**
  * Always match your qualifications to the employer's needs. Prove to him or her that you are capable and willing to solve the problems he or she faces.
