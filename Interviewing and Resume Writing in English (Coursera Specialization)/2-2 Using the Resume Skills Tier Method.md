# 2-1 Writing Strong Accomplishment Statements

上一章的 [Example Accomplishment Statements](https://github.com/siyinghan/Notes/blob/master/Interviewing%20and%20Resume%20Writing%20in%20English%20(Coursera%20Specialization)/Material/Example%20Accomplishment%20Statements.pdf)

<br/>

### Tiered method to write accomplishment statements

**Three Tiers** ('tier' in English simply means level)

* **Tier 1:** Write a strong accomplishment statement to provide evidence of a primary competency.
* **Tier 2:** Write another accomplishment statement related to the first and providing evidence of a secondary competency.
* **Tier 3:** Write a third accomplishment statement related to the two and providing evidence of a tertiary competency.

#### To construct a tiered accomplishment statement

1. Choose a primary competency based on relevancy to the job. (write this accomplishment statement using the strategies you learned in the previous lesson)
2. Choose a related secondary competency that is also relevant. (write that as a string accomplishment statement and position it as a **bullet point** under the first)
3. Choose a related tertiary competency of further relevance. (write that as yet another strong accomplishment statement, and position it as a **second bullet point**)

### Example

Three **competencies**:

* analytic skills
* creative skills
* communication skills

##### Primary Accomplishment

`Analyzed 12 months of customer feedback and determined what vocabulary needed to be rearranged or replaced in phone support scripts.`

You use the action word **analyze** to convey this competency. The situation or problem that is implied relates to some kind of inefficiency and technical support responses. Your task was to fix the problem.

##### Secondary Accomplishment

`Wrote new phone support scripts that decreased phone time by more than 51% in the first six months saving an estimated $280,000 in labor costs.`

As part of fulfilling this task, following your **analysis**, this is the action you took. You wrote *new support scripts* and the result was a significant reduction in the time that support techs had to spend on the phone with a commensurate reduction in labor costs. You quantified the results in concrete terms.

##### Tertiary Accomplishment

`Trained phone support employees and new recruits with new scripts which reduced training time from 2 weeks to 3 days.`

Demonstrating your **communication** and **leadership** skills, you took the action of *training support employees*, which led to an impressive result in *reduced training times*.

##### How this would look on a resume?
