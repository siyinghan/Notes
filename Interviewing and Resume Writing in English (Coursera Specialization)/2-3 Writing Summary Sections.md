# 2-3 Writing Summary Sections

[**Examples of Resume Summary Statements**](https://github.com/siyinghan/Notes/blob/master/Interviewing%20and%20Resume%20Writing%20in%20English%20(Coursera%20Specialization)/Material/Examples%20of%20Resume%20Summary%20Statements.pdf)

<br/>

Every resume you write will contain either an **objective** or a **summary** section. Which you choose depends on the purpose of your resume, but in either case the text should mirror the language of the job posting. It should be aligned with the needs of the hiring organization. In this lesson you'll learn
about writing **summary sections**. In the next, you'll learn about writing **objectives**. In a resume you'll use one but not the otherã€‚

**You write an Objective when:**

1. You are just entering the work force
2. You lack experience in your field
3. You are undergoing a career change

**Use a Summary Section when:**

1. You have experience in a field
2. You want to "brand" your skill set (like *iPhone*, *iPad*, *iResume* from *Apple*)
3.  You want to tie experiences together

<br/>

### A superior skills summary

1. Uses relevant **keywords** (keywords that the employer will most likely be looking for)
2. Appears **above the fold** (at the top or at least in the top one-third of the page, just below your *professional title*)
3. **Entices** the readers (tells the employer that your resume is worth reading)

<br/>

### Example

Here is an example of a summary section from a resume for **a senior marketing professional**.

> Creative and business-savvy marketing and communications professional with 10 years of progressive experience across a broad range of marketing functions and diverse industry segments. Proven ability to combine vision, creativity, and strong business acumen with well-developed project management and leadership qualities to support go-to-market efforts, product launches, and branding-rebranding initiatives, positioning companies and products for success. **Areas of expertise include:**

This summary captures what defines the candidate as a **professional**. It also conveys what he **enjoys** about his work. And it **aligns with the requirements** that an organization looking for a marketing manager would have.

As with accomplishment statements, the summary section **does not use personal pronouns**, **nor does it use finite verbs**.

This particular candidate went one step further with his summary section. He **listed areas of expertise**. Here's what follows his summary section:

Notice the use of **keyword nouns**. **Nouns** are often more important than verbs because they capture the **keywords** entered as search criteria by the hiring manager. Some of the nouns here repeat what's
found in the summary section. The overall effect is to make the candidate sound exactly like the person the employer hopes to find.

### To craft a skills summary

1. **Figure out where you're going** (need to be **concise**, must know exactly what **competencies** to highlight)
   * Ask yourself what **skills** you most enjoy using?
   * What **accomplishment** best illustrate your abilities?
   * What areas you are most **passionate** about working in?
2. **Analyze your target industry** (identify where you want to be, highlighting the importance of our research)
   * Asked yourself what **aligns** most closely with the priorities of the hiring organization?
   * What **competencies** matter most in the target position?
   * What you would look for if you were the hiring manage?
3. **Find your fit and condense**
   * Figure our how you **fit** in, or want to fit in, to the target organization.
   * Identify your **key selling points**.
   * Think about the **organizational problems** you're well positioned to solve.
   * Ask yourself where the **intersection** is of what you want and want your target organization needs.
