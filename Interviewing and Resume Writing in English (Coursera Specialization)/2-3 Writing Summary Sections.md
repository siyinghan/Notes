# 2-3 Writing Summary Sections

[**Examples of Resume Summary Statements**](https://github.com/siyinghan/Notes/blob/master/Interviewing%20and%20Resume%20Writing%20in%20English%20(Coursera%20Specialization)/Material/Examples%20of%20Resume%20Summary%20Statements.pdf)

<br/>

Every resume you write will contain either an **objective** or a **summary** section. Which you choose depends on the purpose of your resume, but in either case the text should mirror the language of the job posting. It should be aligned with the needs of the hiring organization. In this lesson you'll learn
about writing **summary sections**. In the next, you'll learn about writing **objectives**. In a resume you'll use one but not the otherã€‚

**You write an Objective when:**

1. You are just entering the work force
2. You lack experience in your field
3. You are undergoing a career change

**Use a Summary Section when:**

1. You have experience in a field
2. You want to "brand" your skill set (like *iPhone*, *iPad*, *iResume* from *Apple*)
3.  You want to tie experiences together

<br/>

#### A superior skills summary

1. Uses relevant **keywords** (keywords that the employer will most likely be looking for)
2. Appears **above the fold** (at the top or at least in the top one-third of the page, just below your *professional title*)
3. **Entices** the readers (tells the employer that your resume is worth reading)

<br/>

### Example

Here is an example of a summary section from a resume for **a senior marketing professional**.

> Creative and business-savvy marketing and communications professional with 10 years of progressive
