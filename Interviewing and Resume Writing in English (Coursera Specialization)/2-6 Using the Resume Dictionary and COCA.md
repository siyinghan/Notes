# 2-6 Using the Resume Dictionary and COCA





Let's say you ***managed the marketing department of 100 people that experience growth under your leadership***. How would you best describe this accomplishment in a resume? Compare these two versions:

> **A.** **Responsible** for a large, profitable department at XYZ Industries.

> **B.** **Managed** a **100-person** marketing department for XYZ Industries, which grew company profits **by 50%**.

**Why to pick the second example?**

* The second example starts off with a strong action word, **managed**. The term **responsible for** provides absolutely no information about how involved you were with the task, plus it robs you of any credit you might due. The work **managed** tells the employer that you have **leadership skills**.
* The second example is **specific**. It tells an employer that you didn't just manage a large department, you manage a department of **100 people**. That shows precisely what your circle of accountability was.
* The second example states exactly how **profitable** your department was. It increased profits by **50%**. Profits grow under your **leadership**, and you get **credit** for that. (On the other hand, in the first example, you get no credit for your department's success. The phrasing gives the feeling that the department basically grew by itself.)

<br/>

Consider another example:

> **A.** **Restructured** the **entire** production department, which **boosted** productivity by 50%.

> **B.** **Organized** the production department, which **increased** productivity by 50%.

Neither one of these is bad, but the first one is stronger.

* To **restructure** is to **rethink**, **innovate**, and **conceptualize** a whole new structure, and that goes far beyond simple organizing.
* The first example emphasized a restructuring of the **entire department**. And *productivity* wasn't simply **increased**, it was **boosted**, a much more potent word.

<br/>

The description **action** words you use on a resume should be ***grouped in terms of their relative power***. For example, you were responsible for **managing**, **developing**, and **implementing** a program. Which word do you put first?

* **Developing** shows an employer that you can create ideas independently. That's very powerful.
* **Managing** shows that you can lead others to accomplish goals. Less powerful, but still powerful.
* **Implementing** shows that you can carry out ideas. That's the least powerful of the three.

So on your resume you say you **developed**, **managed**, and **implemented** the program. That's how you use action words to supercharge your resume.

<br/>

### Writing powerful resumes means both:

* **using powerful language** and
* **avoiding weak language**
