# 4-2 Constructing the Letter

Example letter from the lecture: [**Enterprise Architecture Cover Letter**](https://github.com/siyinghan/Notes/blob/master/Interviewing%20and%20Resume%20Writing%20in%20English%20(Coursera%20Specialization)/Material/Enterprise%20Architecture%20Cover%20Letter.pdf)

### To Hold the Reader's Attention

* **Use white space and short focused phrases.**
* **Use bullets to cut through the clutter.**
  * Bullets cut through the clutter to emphasize key points, these bold dots immediately draw the reader's attention to your **key strengths**.
  * Think it of this way, If an employer has only a few seconds to evaluate you, what do you want him or her see first. You want his or her to focus on your **strongest skills and capabilities** and **why you are a perfect match** for the organization. That's what you get with bullets.
* **Use three or four short paragraphs.**
  * The perfect cover letter is about three or four paragraphs in length. Never make the mistake of cramming all your text in to one long jumbled paragraph.
* **Use professional stock for printing.**
  * Once you've finished editing the cover letter, print it on the same paper stock as your resume. This way, the entire package the employer receives has a consistent professional appearance.

Before you begin, make sure you have the correct information to put in the heading of your cover letter:

The current format is shown here:

The text is ***left justified***, with a ***date*** on the first line followed by a black line, then the address information with name title at the top.

In Microsoft Word, I generally set the top margin at one and a half inches, the bottom margin at three inches, then set the vertical alignment to center with 1.25 inch margins left and right. That usually produces an attractive visual layout:

#### The Greeting or Salutation

#### Opening Paragraph

You could write something like this, employers do like to know how an applicant found out about the position, that helps them figure out where their marketing is most effective, but an opening like this is ***not much of a hook***.

> I am responding to the Enterprise Architect position advertised on your website.

Here is a ***more personal*** approach. The job posting from Astrazeneca for an enterprise architect started with the question answered here. By picking up on that question an opening with to answer your question, this opening makes an immediate connection with the reader. Answering yes allows you to create the sense of an on going dialog:

> To answer your question - the one posed by the ad on your website for an Enterprise Architect - yes, I do love understanding how a business really works and what it needs to change to stay competitive.

An even better opening is possible if you can claim a personal connection with someone in the organization. Perhaps you know someone, even through LinkedIn or you met someone at a job fair:

> Mike Walker recommended that I contact you regarding the Enterprise Architect position on you CTO team.

If you've already managed to make direct contact with the person in charge of hiring, this too puts you one up over other applicants who didn't exert that little extra effort. So you can open with something like this:

> I very much enjoyed speaking with you today about the Enterprise Architect position.

Not surprisingly, one of the best ways to grab a prospective employers attention is with a compliment. So you try a bit strategic personal flattery, like this.

> Mike said that you had one of the finest strategic minds he had ever met.

Or you give the organization a pat on the back. With an opening like this, not only are you tooting the hiring manager's horn, you're showing him that you did your homework:

> I understand that AstraZeneca is a leader in the biopharmaceuticals industry and that your group has spearheaded a number of their most successful enterprise initiatives.

Okay, here's your opening:

> Mike Walker recommended that I contact you regarding the Enterprise Architect position on your CTO team. He said that yours was one of the finest strategic minds he had ever met and that you have spearheaded a number of AstraZeneca's most successful enterprise initiatives.

### Body Paragraphs

The body of the cover letter answers the fundamental questions that drive the hiring process:

* **Why should the hiring manager consider you?**
* **What makes you stand out?**

To answer these questions you talk about your strong related skills qualify you for the position.

For this example, you're going to be an enterprise architect, and you select the following as the most impressive and relevant points of your resume. This is your lead:

> Overall: Exceptional ability to communicate, deal with organizational politics and take on bold organizational challenges.

Your first competency, you'll recognize this as a leading 21st century competency, here it's put in the specific context of an enterprise architect:

> Problem solving: Solved a range of complex and unique problems in migrating payloads to cloud services at [XYZ].

The second competency highlights your relevant experience using **key words** directly from the job posting:

> Application Architecture Experience: Deployed IAAS strategies with SAP enterprise systems. Proficient in the use of Veela and ServiceNow.

The third competency highlights your ability to work across organizational lines and in a leadership capacity:

> Data Architecture Experience: Co-authored data governance policies at [XYZ] as chair of the Architectural Review Board.

Notice also that each phrase starts with a powerful action word, ***solve***, ***deployed***, ***co-authored***. These words accomplish the same goal that they did in your resume. They present you as a doer and an achiever.

#### Last Paragraph - Close

This is where a conventional cover letter will lead you astray, but you'll learn more about that in the next lesson. For now, you're going to close the letter with this text:

> I would like to learn more about this position and how I might assist you. Please call me at 555 555-1111 within the next ten days. After that, I must make a decision about committing to another project and will no longer be available.
