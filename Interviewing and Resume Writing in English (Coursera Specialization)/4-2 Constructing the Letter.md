# 4-2 Constructing the Letter

Example letter from the lecture: [**Enterprise Architecture Cover Letter**](https://github.com/siyinghan/Notes/blob/master/Interviewing%20and%20Resume%20Writing%20in%20English%20(Coursera%20Specialization)/Material/Enterprise%20Architecture%20Cover%20Letter.pdf)

### To Hold the Reader's Attention

* **Use white space and short focused phrases.**
* **Use bullets to cut through the clutter.**
  * Bullets cut through the clutter to emphasize key points, these bold dots immediately draw the reader's attention to your **key strengths**.
  * Think it of this way, If an employer has only a few seconds to evaluate you, what do you want him or her see first. You want his or her to focus on your **strongest skills and capabilities** and **why you are a perfect match** for the organization. That's what you get with bullets.
* **Use three or four short paragraphs.**
  * The perfect cover letter is about three or four paragraphs in length. Never make the mistake of cramming all your text in to one long jumbled paragraph.
* **Use professional stock for printing.**
  * Once you've finished editing the cover letter, print it on the same paper stock as your resume. This way, the entire package the employer receives has a consistent professional appearance.
