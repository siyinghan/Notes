**Statement Example 1** *marketing communications manager with a bit more than 10 years of experience*

```Built event-management program from ground up. Constructed exhibits to showcase products, managed logistics, and trained a telesales organization. Generated $4M return on investment to date.```

- 使用过去时 built, constructed, managed, trained，因为表示已经做完的事情，a result achieved

- result是什么：generated $4 million return on investment to date

<br/>

**Statement Example 2** *demonstrataes team leadership competency*

```Coordinated multigenerational team of 12 sales, administrative and technical support employees selling printing equipment and services to healthcare customers in 23 states in the Eastern U.S.```

- 开头用了动词 **coordinated**。If you coordinate a team, you get all the members to work effectively as a whole.
- 使用 **sales**、**administration**、**technical support** 强调 get different groups to work cooperatively 的能力。
- **multigenerational** 是一个 particularly desirable 21st century competency。

### The 2nd Principle

describe:

1. What the **situation** was / what the **problem** was that you solved?
2. What **action** did you take?
3. What was the **result**?
4. How did you organization **benefit** from what you did?

**Statement Example:**

```Developed Access-based accounting database that reduced billing errors to almost 0% while bringing average collection times from over 90 to less than 30 days. Resulting billing accuracy restored confidence from the client and eliminated much management overhead.```

1. **problem**: a high rate of billing errors and a protracted AR cycle
2. **action**: design and develop a database
3. **results**: results in *quantifiable terms* communicate that something of values was accomplished

<br/>

**manage**, **budget**, **design**, **convert**, **customize**, **remodel**, **transform**, **facilitate**, **motivate**, **navigate**, **negotiate**, etc.

<br/>

**specific details** to prove your **credibility**, and to show you actually have experience in a particular area

<br/>

### The 5th Principle

The person reading your resume needs to understand how **valuable** your accomplishment was to an organization.

**Example:**

A. `Managed human resources department for division.`

B. `Directed human resources for 1,100 employee division of Fortune 500 company; directly supervised seven human resources professionals and three clerks and managed budget of $1.5 million.`

<br/>

### Writing up your Accomplishment

1. **What did you do?** (What problem did you solve? What new processes did you implement?)
2. **Paint the picture with numbers.** (How many people were impacted? By what percentage did you exceed your goals? How much money did you earn or save?)
3. **Add the benefits to the organization** (The things you've accomplished will mean much more if you can demonstrate how they helpd advance the goals of the organization.)

<br/>

### The 6th Principle

You want to say as much as you can, in as few words as you need.

Eliminate words like **various** and **numerous** and use actual **numbers** instead. Remove **pronouns** and **articles** that do not add to your content. Also, it is better to round off **numbers** and **percentages** than to use words like **approximately** or **around**.
