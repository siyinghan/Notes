# 3-6 What You Should Never Put on a Resume

### Six of the Most Common Resume Killers

* **Salary expectations or history**
  * Remember, it's always best to discuss salary requirements after an offer has been made.
* **Personal data**
* **Hobbies or personal interests**
  * The only time that including hobbies or personal interests on a resume is a good idea, is when your interests are relevant to the position for which you're applying. For the most part, you can cover this in the actual interview.
* **Reasons for leaving pervious jobs**
* **Your picture**
  * In some organizations, putting your picture on a resume eliminates it automatically. These organizations want to avoid exposure to possible discrimination complaints. Discrimination protections notwithstanding, pictures simply give employers another reason to reject your resume.
* **Eye candy**
  * The first is ***cute graphics***. On a resume these immediately send the message that you are not to be taken seriously.
  * The second are the ***info graphics*** you'll see advertised on the internet. They're popular with graphic designers, but they're heavily from all fields.

<br/>
For **example**, here are excerpts from an ***info graphic*** recommendation for Asian job applicants. Much of this is **misinformation**.

1. No resume will ever get you a job. The purpose of a resume is to get you an **interview**.
2. The idea of using progress bars to show your proficiencies in particular skills is complete fluff. Your claims mean nothing without concrete evidence to back them up.
3. The ***when*** in doubt box has four typos in it, even though one of its call outs is to proof read, in order to avoid typos.

<br/>

Take a look at this **example**. Again, three glaring flaws jump out that would put this resume in the trash.

1. Squandering the resume real estate like this raises serious questions about the candidates ability to prioritize.
2. There is a fatal spelling mistake in work experience on the left. The candidate might claim attention to detail, but his resume proves the claim to be empty.
3. There is the skills chart again on the right.

The principle at work here is simple:

**Put nothing on your resume that gives a reviewer a reason to reject you.**
