# 3-6 What You Should Never Put on a Resume

### Six of the Most Common Resume Killers

* **Salary expectations or history**
  * Remember, it's always best to discuss salary requirements after an offer has been made.
* **Personal data**
* **Hobbies or personal interests**
  * The only time that including hobbies or personal interests on a resume is a good idea, is when your interests are relevant to the position for which you're applying. For the most part, you can cover this in the actual interview.
* **Reasons for leaving pervious jobs**
* **Your picture**
  * In some organizations, putting your picture on a resume eliminates it automatically. These organizations want to avoid exposure to possible discrimination complaints. Discrimination protections notwithstanding, pictures simply give employers another reason to reject your resume.
* **Eye candy**
  * The first is ***cute graphics***. On a resume these immediately send the message that you are not to be taken seriously.
  * The second are the ***info graphics*** you'll see advertised on the internet. They're popular with graphic designers, but they're heavily from all fields.

<br/>
For **example**, here are excerpts from an ***info graphic*** recommendation for Asian job applicants. Much of this is **misinformation**.

1. No resume will ever get you a job. The purpose of a resume is to get you an **interview**.
2. The idea of using progress bars to show your proficiencies in particular skills is complete fluff. Your claims mean nothing without concrete evidence to back them up.
3. The ***when*** in doubt box has four typos in it, even though one of its call outs is to proof read, in order to avoid typos.

Take a look at this **example**. Again, three glaring flaws jump out that would put this resume in the trash.
