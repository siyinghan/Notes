# 4-3 Creating a Sense of Urgency

> Because we have a limited window of opportunity, please contact me immediately.

> Before I make another decision that makes me unavailable, please contact me.

> Please contact me before (date) as I have promised to make a decision regarding a new project by then and may no longer be available.

> Please contact me right away as I am in town for only two more weeks.

> I am presently between projects and before making a commitment would like to meet with you.

These statements do work. They create a sense of urgency and limit your availability. After all, there is only one of you on the market. Sure, you have competition. But, you are unique. When you create a perception of your limited availability, you're using one of the most powerful motivators known to all businesses.

**Your service are the product ...**

**... the employer is the customer.**

### Cover Letter Death by Clich√©

* **Please (do not hesitate to) contact me at ...** (This sounds like begging, or the variation, please call me anytime, which sound desperate.)
* **You can contact me at ...** (This sounds condescending. I've actually read cover letters that use, you have my permission to contact me, which is even worse.)
* **If interested, please contact me at ...** (This is one of the worst. First of all, it's begging. Second, placing the phrase, if interested, before the call to action, diminished the power of the call.)
* **Contact me at ... if you have any questions.** (This is limiting. Is this the only reason to call?)
* **Looking forward to meeting you.** (This is presumptuous, who's to say you're going to meet me, and it's not much better if you write, looking forward to hearing from you.)
* **Call me at ... when you have a chance.** (This say, after all this matter's not important, if you have free time during your busy day, when you never have any free time, go ahead and pick up the phone.)

So what is good? Try this:

**I would like to learn more about this position and how I might assist you. Please call me at 555 555-1111.**

A direct, simple, straightforward call to action. Combine it with a limited availability line, and you have a great close.
