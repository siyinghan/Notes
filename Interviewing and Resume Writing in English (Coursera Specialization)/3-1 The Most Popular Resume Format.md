# 3-1 The Most Popular Resume Format

### Basic Elements of Every Resume

* **Skills Summary or Job Objective** (under the headline with your contact information and target job title)
* **Experience** (namely your employers, dates of employment, and job titles)
* **Accomplishments** (Using the strategies you learned earlier)
* **Competencies (or skills or capabilities)** (Using the strategies you learned earlier)
* **Education** (your schools, degrees, any honors, majors, thesis topics...)

### Other Sections

* **Volunteer Work**
* **Licenses** (for skills that are relevant to the position)
* **Languages** (human or computer, generally have relevance)
* **Special Skills** (that are relevant to the position)
* **Publications** (whether books or articles, white papers, or other materials, may be relevant)
* **Honors and Awards** (you've been given may be relevant)
* **Seminars** (you're attended, or you've given may be relevant, also sometimes referred to as workshops)
* **Affiliations** (you have in professional associations may also be relevant to the specific marketing purpose that you've chosen for a resume)

Remember, you are not including every possible item on every resume you write. Each resume you write is a **marketing document** with a **specific target audience**. As such, each resume you write is crafted for a **specific purpose**.

### Chronological Format

* **Header Section** (including ***contact information*** and ***target job title***)
* **Summary or Objective**
* **Work History** (in detail in chronological order, list ***accomplishments*** under each position using the same competency based focus you learned about in the last module)
* **Education**
  * listing the highest or most recent degree first, ***you do not necessarily include dates in this section***
  * under education, you may choose to list a relevant **thesis title** or topic, along with any **academic awards** or honors
  * you may find it relevant to mention **special seminars** or **conferences** you've attended or **training** you received ------ showing that you have the most up to date training could well be important

### Use the Chronological Format to Show

* **Your career has progressed in a straight line** (this format is effective if your career has moved into a steady straight line progression)
* **You have been groomed for the target job**
* **You want to continue working in the same field**

### Avoid the Chronological Format When

* **You have been out of the workforce for a time**
* **You are switching to another field or career** (a chronological resume will make you look like the wrong person for the job, it will draw attention to the fact that all your experience is in a different field)
* **You don't have much experience in the field** (if you're a recent graduate who doesn't have much experience a chronological resume will only underscore this weakness)
* **You have gaps in your employment record** (if you were laid off or fired from one job and had to take a lesser job in a different field then a chronological resume will make this only too obvious)
