# 3-3 Two Special Resume Formats

The **skill resume format** is used if you have ***extensive experience*** in a ***special area***.

### The Skills Resume

* **Extensive experience in one filed**
* **Tightly focused background** (your background is so tightly focused that there's only one job title you could apply for without changing industries or taking a step backwards)
* **Emphasis on unique qualifications**
* **Combined resume is not enough**
  * If you're a senior executive who has been employed in the same industry for 20 years or more. Maybe you've been a senior vice president in the industry for 15 of those years. You can't go any higher unless you become president of the company, but the president isn't going anywhere in the near future. So the only job you can apply for, is the same position, in a different company. This situation might also apply if you were in another highly specific field like teaching, computing, or advertising.
