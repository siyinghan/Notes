# 3-3 Two Special Resume Formats

The **skill resume format** is used if you have ***extensive experience*** in a ***special area***.

### The Skills Resume

* **Extensive experience in one filed**
* **Tightly focused background** (your background is so tightly focused that there's only one job title you could apply for without changing industries or taking a step backwards)
* **Emphasis on unique qualifications**
* **Combined resume is not enough**
  * If you're a senior executive who has been employed in the same industry for 20 years or more. Maybe you've been a senior vice president in the industry for 15 of those years. You can't go any higher unless you become president of the company, but the president isn't going anywhere in the near future. So the only job you can apply for, is the same position, in a different company. This situation might also apply if you were in another highly specific field like teaching, computing, or advertising.

For this format, the summary section will take up roughly half of the first page. It will include the template elements you see here, namely the **headline**, the **summary section**, and a bulleted list of **key competencies**. You're already familiar with these elements from previous examples, but you can see here how this format allow you to focus a reviewer's attention on your uniquely strong qualifications.

Here's an example where the template fields have been filled in. This candidate called out her key
competencies under the heading, **EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP COMPETENCIES**. You could use whatever heading is appropriate to your field.

Then this candidate included a section, âˆ«. That section abstracts her
accomplishments across a 20 year career. Again, the format presents
the unique qualifications and high level skills of the candidate
in a manner that's easy to scan. You may include more optional sections in
a skills resume to stress the fullness of your qualifications. A skills resume will likely run two or
three pages in contrast to the one to two
page standard resume format. The next format we'll look at is
the curriculum vitae, or CV format. This format is designed for
academics, college professors, deans, lecturers and researchers. Private
