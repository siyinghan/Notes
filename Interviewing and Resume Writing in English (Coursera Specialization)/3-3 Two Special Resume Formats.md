# 3-3 Two Special Resume Formats

The **skill resume format** is used if you have ***extensive experience*** in a ***special area***.

### The Skills Resume

* **Extensive experience in one filed**
* **Tightly focused background** (your background is so tightly focused that there's only one job title you could apply for without changing industries or taking a step backwards)
* **Emphasis on unique qualifications**
* **Combined resume is not enough**
  * If you're a senior executive who has been employed in the same industry for 20 years or more. Maybe you've been a senior vice president in the industry for 15 of those years. You can't go any higher unless you become president of the company, but the president isn't going anywhere in the near future. So the only job you can apply for, is the same position, in a different company. This situation might also apply if you were in another highly specific field like teaching, computing, or advertising.

For this format, the summary section will take up roughly half of the first page. It will include the template elements you see here, namely the **headline**, the **summary section**, and a bulleted list of **key competencies**. You're already familiar with these elements from previous examples, but you can see here how this format allow you to focus a reviewer's attention on your uniquely strong qualifications.

Here's an example where the template fields have been filled in. This candidate called out her key
competencies under the heading, **EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP COMPETENCIES**. You could use whatever heading is appropriate to your field. Then this candidate included a section, **TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS**. That section abstracts her ***accomplishments*** across a 20 year career. Again, the format presents the unique qualifications and high level skills of the candidate in a manner that's easy to scan.

A skills resume will likely run **two or three pages** in contrast to the **one to two page** standard resume format.

### Curriculum Vitae (CV)

* **Academic CVs follow a unique format**
  * This format is designed for *academics*, *college professors*, *deans*, *lecturers* and *researchers*. *Private school principals* or *clergy* may also need this format.

* **Detailed overview of accomplishments**

  * Standard resumes are usually no more than one page long, two at the most. They're typically accompanied by cover letters, which you'll learn about in the next module. In contrast, a CV is a fairly detailed overview of your life's accomplishments, especially those most relevant to academia where CVs have their greatest utility.

* **A dynamic accomplishments inventory**

  * Academic researchers are often working on many projects simultaneously, so it's best to think of a CV as a living document that needs to be updated frequently. You can think of it as a running accomplishments inventory. If you're at the beginning stages of your academic career, your CV will only be two or three pages long. A more seasoned researcher's CV may run into double digits.
  * Nevertheless, for an initial application most experts recommend no more than four pages when submitting a CV for consideration.

This is another way of saying that although the CV differs from a resume, you still tailor your CV for every academic application. You still analyze the job description and specification, just like you would for a non academic application.

Your CV needs to present strong evidence that you fulfill the job requirements, just like a resume needs to provide strong evidence that you have the competencies required for a job.

* Highlight your academic achievements and research interests.
* Find out as much as you can about the research area you're applying to so you understand how your expertise compliments the goals of the research organization.
* Spell out your qualifications, research, publications in any other relevant information.
* Describe your contribution to publications, particularly high impact publications including your summary, statement of research interest, every thing you've learn about interviewing in resume writing.

#### Curriculum Vitae (CV) Elements

* **Publications**
  * A CV contains a reverse chronological list of publications, often presented in an appendix. Include journal articles, books or chapters of books, reports, and patents.

* **Research experience**
    * Research experience is listed in reverse chronological order. Emphasize specialist and technical expertise, I.T. skills, plus any skills required for the job including people and project management.

* **Education**
    * Education is presented in reverse chronological order. Focus on higher education onwards. Include awards and scholarships. Include the name of your doctoral supervisor and funding body if appropriate.

* **Funding**
    * Under funding include awards for research projects or to attend meetings or conferences and prizes. Include the amount of money allocated where useful.

* **Teaching Experience**
    * In your teaching experience include lecturing, supervision, demonstrating, curriculum development, seminar and group work assessment and any other relevant teaching competencies. This is required if teaching is in the job description.

* **Administrative Experience**
    * Under administrative experience, highlight any positions of responsibility, event and course organization, committee membership, and other administrative responsibilities. You must include this section if administrative duties are in the job description.

* **Professional Qualifications**
    * Under professional qualifications list your membership in any learned societies or professional bodies. You should also list any teaching and learning qualifications.

* **Professional Development**
    * Under professional development document your activities including any training undertaken, specialist research methods, or analytic techniques you've developed or
learned. You might also include time management training, training in academic writing, or
any research supervision you've received. Research supervision you've conducted should be listed under ***teaching experience***.

* **Conferences and Seminars**
    * Your attendance at conferences and seminars should be documented. Highlight any invitations to present to provide papers or posters. If you've given many presentations,
you can include a separate section for presentations.

* **References**
    * Finally, include the contact and professional details of two or three references. At least two should be academic. Be sure to ask their permission first.

There you have it. Two special format resumes, both of which, however use the principles of strong accomplishment statements, powerful active language, and targeted focus, that you learned for all the other resume formats.
