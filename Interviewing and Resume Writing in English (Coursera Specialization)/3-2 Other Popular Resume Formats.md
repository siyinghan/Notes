# 3-2 Other Popular Resume Formats

If you're changing careers, or re-entering the job market, if your career has had setbacks or includes jobs in different industries, if your current job is not as impressive as your last one or if your skills and accomplishments are more impressive than your career history, then a **functional resume** will likely be the right choice for you.

### Functional Format

* **Header Section**  (including ***contact information*** and ***target job title***)
* **Summary or Objective**
  * if you're changing careers or reentering the job market, your best choice is probably the **job objective**
  * but if you've chosen this format to highlight your ***skills*** and ***accomplishments*** then the **summary** would be your choice
* **Accomplishments** (*Work History* in the chronological format)
  * this section is where the **functional resume** differs from the **chronological**
  * the idea is to take your **achievements** and **competencies** out of the work history section, and put them together under **accomplishments**
  * this focuses the employer's attention on ***what you can do and have done*** rather than ***where and when you have worked***, that let you emphasize your **competencies** and demonstrate them through your **accomplishments**
* **Work History**
  * only after impressing the employer with your **accomplishments** and **skills** do you present your ***work history*** in a brief format with dates
  * this **chronological list** of your work history comes after your **accomplishments**, near the end of the resume, but before education or other sections

The writing style here is to list **accomplishments** under each **competency area**. Begin with the most important **competency area** for the position you are applying for.

### Example 1

Here is a functional resume entry for a candidate who's competencies in ***business development*** are a key selling point for the position he's interested in. Notice the use of **a bulleted list** to make it easier for an employer to read quickly.

In this example, you can see how the candidates list of **achievements**, provided **evidence of his competency** in ***marketing and business development***. But perhaps he achieved those accomplishments in different organizations or in different fields. The functional format lets him emphasize ***what he can do***, not ***where or when he did it***.

### Example 2

If you've been working as a ***Quality Control technician*** for a ***pharmaceutical company***. After a couple of years, you've decided that you want to be in a ***less structured and higher growth industry***. So you pick ***computer field***. You want to get a job in ***Technical Support***. Your resume should thus emphasize the skills that will support your desire to change careers.

Now, in working through the question presented in the first module, you note that along with the ***performing technical laboratory tests*** you also configured new databases, you ***upgraded*** and ***managed*** all the computers for a 25 person staff. You also performed ***computerized tests*** to ensure product uniformity and to ***debug*** product issues.

Before your current job, you had three years experience as a ***telephone medical sales*** representative. Your tasks included ***describing product specifications*** to customers, many of whom had very little medical knowledge. You helped determine specific medical products for ***500 customers***, helping them select the best products to meet their needs.
