# 3-2 Other Popular Resume Formats

If you're changing careers, or re-entering the job market, if your career has had setbacks or includes jobs in different industries, if your current job is not as impressive as your last one or if your skills and accomplishments are more impressive than your career history, then a **functional resume** will likely be the right choice for you.

### Functional Format

* **Header Section**  (including ***contact information*** and ***target job title***)
* **Summary or Objective**
  * if you're changing careers or reentering the job market, your best choice is probably the **job objective**
  * but if you've chosen this format to highlight your ***skills*** and ***accomplishments*** then the **summary** would be your choice
* **Accomplishments** (*Work History* in the chronological format)
  * this section is where the **functional resume** differs from the **chronological**
  * the idea is to take your **achievements** and **competencies** out of the work history section, and put them together under **accomplishments**
  * this focuses the employer's attention on ***what you can do and have done*** rather than ***where and when you have worked***, that let you emphasize your **competencies** and demonstrate them through your **accomplishments**
* **Work History**
  * only after impressing the employer with your **accomplishments** and **skills** do you present your ***work history*** in a brief format with dates
  * this **chronological list** of your work history comes after your **accomplishments**, near the end of the resume, but before education or other sections

The writing style here is to list **accomplishments** under each **competency area**. Begin with the most important **competency area** for the position you are applying for.
