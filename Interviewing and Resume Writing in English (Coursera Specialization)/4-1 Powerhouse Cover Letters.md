### Steps in Writing a Cover Letter

* **Make a connection with the prospective employer and grab his or her attention.**
* **Arouse interest and the desire to find out more about how you can fill the job need.**
  * You should find out all you can about the ***employer*** and the ***position***. Read and reread their employment advertisements, read the ads for other positions within the same organization, look for similarities in wording. Then using the **key skill words** the ***employer*** has used in the ad, using the **power vocabulary** that you've learned and ***conveying your limited availability***, you create the desire to find out more about you.
* **Move the reader to call you for an interview.**
